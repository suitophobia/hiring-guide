# Example hiring process for larger company

1. **Schedule some time with the candidate for a quick phone call to introduce yourself and your company.** It’s important that you convey your employer value proposition during this call (why should somebody want to work at your company), while also clarifying any details about the candidate that weren’t obvious from their profiles.
2. **If both parties are happy to proceed, assign the candidate an online technical test.** Make sure that they understand how to access the test, and are well briefed beforehand on any time limits or special criteria. Once they have submitted the test, get somebody from your dev team to sanity check the results.
3. Due to the company’s size, the founders are not involved in hiring every new team member. **If the results of the technical assessment were satisfactory, arrange for the candidate to come in for an on site structured interview with the hiring team and at least one technical team member who will run through a quick technical interview to cover anything that wasn’t included in the online test.** Ensure that everybody is well briefed beforehand; the interviewers on what they will be assessing, and the candidate on who they will be meeting as well as what kinds of questions they can expect.
4. If the feedback from the technical and culture interviews is good, **call at least 2 references,** making sure to focus on gathering disconfirming information, rather than simply asking them to list what they liked about the person. Because of your work in the finance sector, organise to have criminal and credit checks run on the candidate via fingerprint scan. Give them a call beforehand to give them context on why this needs to be done, and to pass along how they will be carried out.
5. If the candidate possesses the competencies to meet the outcomes that you set out in your scorecard and the reference calls and other checks don’t raise any red flags, **have who was involved in the interview process give the candidate a call to tell them the good news and that you’re putting together an offer** (be prepared to answer questions). This should then be followed up with an official offer as soon as possible.
6. As soon as the candidate accepts the offer and a start date has been agreed on, **their future team-lead should give them a call to discuss how they can start preparing for day one.** This includes **getting set up with a laptop** and **access for accounts** they’re going to be using. This person is now part of the team, so it’s the team lead’s responsibility to make sure that they’re invited to any team events that are scheduled prior to their start date.

The final phases of these two processes are quite similar. We find that regardless of company size, after the candidate has come in for an interview **most of your success in hiring will hinge on how quickly and effectively you can execute your own internal processes.** Once you have determined that somebody can meet your technical requirements and will be a good addition to your company culture, there shouldn’t be any reason to delay making an offer.
