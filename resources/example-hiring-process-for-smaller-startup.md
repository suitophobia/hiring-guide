1. **Schedule a coffee appointment with the candidate.** Make sure that conversation isn’t you asking them to answer questions for you. Spend time ‘selling the role” to the candidate and give them the chance to ask any questions that they want to.
2. **Schedule an on-site interview to assess technical and cultural fit.**
   1. **Assign a short technical project prior to the interview date.** A technical interview can then be conducted on the day with the project as a focus of discussion.
   2. If the technical assessment comes back positive, **schedule a follow up meeting determine cultural alignment.** In the early stages of your company it’s incredibly important that the founders have an active hand in who joins the team, so a **quick founders chat** is scheduled. At the same time, schedule some time for the candidate to meet with the team leads and senior team members.
3. **Ask the candidate for 2 references that you can call.** Make sure to probe beyond the usual glowing recommendations that are sure to come from somebody who has been asked to serve as a reference.
4. If the candidate possesses the competencies to meet the outcomes that you set out in your scorecard and the reference calls don’t raise any red flags, have who was involved in the interview process **give the candidate a call to tell them the good news and that you’re putting together an offer** (be prepared to answer questions). **This should then be followed up with an official offer as soon as possible.**
5. As soon as the candidate accepts the offer and a start date has been agreed on, **their future team-lead should give them a call to discuss how they can start preparing for day one.** This includes **getting set up with a laptop** and **access for accounts** they’re going to be using. This person is now part of the team, so it’s the team lead’s responsibility to make sure that they’re invited to any team events that are scheduled prior to their start date.
