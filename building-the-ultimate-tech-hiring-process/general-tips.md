# General tips

* Try to have one person take ownership of hiring for any given role. This will help with accountability and minimise the chances of balls being dropped.
* **Be extremely responsive with candidates;** you should never be the bottleneck in your own hiring process.
* Optimise for speed. If somebody meets your hiring criteria, your goal should be to put an offer of employment in their hands as quickly as possible.
* Remember that drop-off will occur throughout every stage of the process, so it’s important to maintain a strong pipeline of candidates.
* The golden thread that should run through your entire process is the [candidate experience.](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/hiring-developers-why-a-candidates-experience-matters) **Always assume that the person you’re interviewing is going to tell their friends/community members about their experience interviewing at your company.**
