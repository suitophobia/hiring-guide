# Sales chat

On the other end of the spectrum to the traditional screening call we find something that is closer to a sales call. **Rather than looking for reasons to filter somebody out, the goal here is to effectively sell the role, the company and its mission as well as the interview process itself.**

Getting buy-in like this is extra important if your hiring process has multiple steps. It’s pretty optimistic to assume that somebody will take time off from their current job to finish your 3 hour technical assessment and sit through an on-site panel interview with your whole management team without any work from your end to sell the idea of working at your company and being part of your team as being worth all that effort.

**This should generally be the strategy that you adopt if you’re trying to build a hiring process that promotes a positive candidate experience.** Remember that there’s nothing wrong with asking a few questions during a chat like this, as long as you keep in mind that it’s just as important to sell the role and your company to the person you’re talking to.
