# Initial conversation

How you approach this part of the hiring process will fall somewhere on a spectrum, with you trying to filter out people who ‘aren’t good enough’ on one end and ‘convincing people that your company is the best’ on the other.

Considering this in the broader context of tech hiring in its current state, your aim should be to adopt more of a selling mindset. **There are potentially a host of other competing organisations all trying to tap into the same talent pool as you are. If you’re not making an effort to convince candidates of why they should choose to work with you, you’ll quickly start losing out to companies who are.**

Your goal at this point in the hiring process should be to maximise knowledge on both sides of the table; candidates should know as much as possible about the work that you do, and you need to know as much as you can about them so as to be able to figure out whether or not they’ll be able to make an impact in your team.

When considering how to structure your initial conversations with people, the medium is an important factor. A face to face discussion should always be first prize, but keep in mind that it can be tough for somebody to find time to do this. Always offer to meet somebody at a location that is most convenient for them, even if it entails a bit of a drive (remember that your selection efforts up until now should mean that you think that this person is at least solid enough to warrant this kind of effort).
