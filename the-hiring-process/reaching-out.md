# Reaching out

### Reaching out <a href="#_reaching_out" id="_reaching_out"></a>

The first step of your hiring process should be to focus inwardly and **decide who is going to be running it.** If you can’t settle on a single person to care about the whole process, then be sure to go into detail in terms of which people are going to take ownership of the individual parts of the process. We have found that the person closest to the role in question should conduct the initial outreach. If you’re hiring a developer, the dev manager or head of product should be reaching out.

Depending on how strong your brand is, the initial message could potentially be the first time the person you’re reaching out to has heard of your company. This means that it’s super important for you to be able to convey your **employer value proposition** concisely and convincingly.

We’ve seen companies on OfferZen reach out in a couple of different ways, namely: the super personal message, the short message and the long message. We suggest picking the one that aligns best with your culture and goals.

An **employer value proposition** is the name given to a broad category of things describing the reasons why somebody would work for your company rather than another one. It is explicitly different to your actual product, meaning you can have an awesome offering but a terrible employer value proposition if you don’t make an effort to provide people with a great place to work. Components of your employee value proposition include:

* Financial benefits
* Perks
* Career development opportunities
* Work content (is it meaning and aligned with an employee’s goals/interests?)

We have seen companies on OfferZen reach out in a couple of different ways, ranging from super personalised notes through to much longer, more detailed messages. Here are a few things to consider when deciding on what kind of initial outreach strategy to adopt:

* **Nothing gives a somebody the warm fuzzies like seeing a message from an interesting company that addresses them as an individual.** Making specific references to parts of a person’s profile that you found particularly interesting is a great way to prove to somebody that you’re serious about engaging with them.
* Personalising every message can take time, so be mindful not to let that affect the number of people that you reach out to. **Your goal should be to strike a balance between thoughtful, personalised outreach and building a healthy candidate pipeline.**
* When reaching out to somebody that you’re interesting in interviewing, **ensure that you provide other ways for candidates to find out more about you and your company.** This information should be easily accessible and give the person a high level overview of what you’re all about.
* If it isn’t practical for the hiring manager to reach out directly themselves, it can be useful to have somebody on your team take on a dedicated hiring support role. This person can own the outreach and interview process, however **they will need to be extremely well briefed on all of the requirements for the roles in question.**
