# Take home project

A take home project is exactly what it sounds like - a piece of work that you assign to a candidate to complete in their own time. As with all of the other types of assessment, it’s massively important to **be explicit about what it is that you’re assessing, what the deliverables are and how long you expect somebody to set aside for the project.**

A well briefed assessment project can easily be used as a jumping off point for a technical discussion during an interview. Getting somebody to talk you through their solution can be incredibly insightful and can tell you a great deal about their decision making and communication style.

Making sure that you assign projects that are relevant to the work your company does unlocks the additional benefit of giving the candidate a window into what to expect should they accept an offer of employment from you. If you’re trying to hire people who enjoy solving interesting problems, be sure to make the assessment you’re asking people to dedicate hours to as engaging and representative of an actual day’s work as possible.
