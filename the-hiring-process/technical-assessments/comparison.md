| Assessment              | What does it assess?                                                                                                                      | Company time investment                                                                                                                                         | Candidate experience                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Technical Interview** | Ability to communicate problem solving process as well as high level. technical understanding of topics.                                  | Dependant on the number of team members involved.                                                                                                               | Dependant on the skill and level of preparation of the interviewer.                                                                                                                       |
| **Whiteboard**          | Ability to logically structure a solution and communicate ones thought process.                                                           | No setup time outside of coming up with the problem. Can be conducted by a single member of the development team.                                               | Generally positive as long as there is a proper briefing around expected parameters (eg code vs pseudocode).                                                                              |
| **Paper Programming**   | Similar to whiteboard assessment, but more difficult to communicate around how the solution was obtained.                                 | Minimal. Test can be written and then assessed at a later date.                                                                                                 | Potentially frustrating to write out code without an IDE, especially if using a specific language rather an pseudocode.                                                                   |
| **Pair Programming**    | Ability to solve problems collaboratively and communicate decision making.                                                                | Potentially high. A number of members of your development team will potentially be working with the candidate.                                                  | Can be quite daunting if it isnâ€™t explained that the person theyâ€™re paired up with isnâ€™t necessarily assessing them.                                                                      |
| **Online Test**         | Proficiency in a specific language and itâ€™s syntax. Useful for measuring computer science fundamentals.                                   | Minimal. Best practice would be to have a dev team member at least double check the results of the marking algorithm.                                           | Quite impersonal, but potentially convenient due to being able to fit it into their own schedule.                                                                                         |
| **Take-home Project**   | Ability to assess a project brief and model a solution in code. Ability to budget time to have the project completed before the deadline. | Up front time investment to set a sane assessment as well as rubric for scoring it. Assessing the project and delivering useful feedback can be time consuming. | Dependant on the quality of the briefing. A poorly briefed project can result in candidates spending too much time answering questions which might not be relevant, which is frustrating. |
