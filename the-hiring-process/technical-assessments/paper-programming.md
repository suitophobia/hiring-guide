# Paper programming

Similar to whiteboard assessments, a strategy that we sometimes see employed is asking somebody to complete a paper based coding test. While whiteboard assessments will typically involve a number of people looking at and discussing a problem, a paper based assessment lends itself more to the traditional paradigm of completing a test paper and handing it in, limiting the amount of insight that you’re able to obtain about how the candidate approached solving the problem at hand.

It’s possible to negate these drawbacks by taking time to ask the candidate to run you through the answers that they submitted, however at this point you might as well have used a whiteboard assessment making paper based tests hard to recommend as an efficient assessment mechanism.
