# Nothing

While doing nothing is always an option, it is very seldom the most effective one. One bad hire early on can do a lot to kneecap your ability to hit product roadmap goals, not to mention the potential cascading negative effects on your company culture.

**You might be saving time in the short term by relying solely on your finely honed intuition, but we strongly recommend doing some form of due diligence** to ensure that the person that youâ€™re adding to your team is able to contribute meaningfully, shore up existing weakness and help you build an awesome product and team.
