# Technical interview

This is potentially the most abstract of the options available to you when looking to assess technical ability. While it can be the most convenient from a candidate experience perspective, it’s also extremely reliant on the person running the interview being highly technical themselves.

**The effectiveness of a technical interview hinges entirely on the strength of the questions that you ask as assessment tools.** While it might feel good to ask a trick question that somebody outside of your building might struggle to answer, you generally want to stick to questions that will allow candidates to showcase their own skill.

If you decide to adopt this strategy, **it’s massively important that the interviewer has a good grasp of the problem that they’re asking the interviewee to solve.** Somebody who doesn’t have a solid understanding of the problem themselves will struggle to move the discussion forward which will greatly limit the amount of information that you’re able to gather about somebody’s technical abilities.
