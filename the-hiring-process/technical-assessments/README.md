# Technical Assessments

If your goal is to build a high quality product, everybody on your team should be up to snuff from a technical perspective. **Anyone who isn’t pulling their weight can be a drain on the rest of team and will severely limit your ability to move quickly.** That’s why an effective technical assessment process is so important.

When deciding on how to do this, the question that you should be asking yourself is: **“Am I trying to filter people out, or am I assessing to find out what people’s strengths are?”.** Sequencing also becomes a consideration at this point. An assessment that is administered closer to the beginning of the process should be designed to determine whether somebody possesses the baseline competencies that are necessary for them to perform well in a given role, while one that is carried out towards the end can be more focussed on confirming what a candidate’s strengths are in order to ensure that they are given work that engages them from day one.

Something that a lot of companies often forget at this stage is just how competitive technical hiring can be. **Any candidate that you’re talking to is most likely engaging with other companies as well.** Having a cumbersome, poorly designed technical assessment strategy is a good way to make sure that your process finds itself at the bottom of a candidate’s to-do list as they prioritise processes that are more respectful of their time.

Proper briefing is also super important when conducting any kind of technical assessment. A poorly briefed assessment project that you think shouldn’t take more than 4 hours can end up taking the whole weekend to complete if you’re not clear on exactly what the deliverables and goals of the project are.
