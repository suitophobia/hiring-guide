# Online test

**If you’re trying to optimise your hiring process to be able to handle really high volumes of people, then** [**an online test**](https://www.codility.com) **can be a good way to accomplish that.** [These kinds of assessments](https://www.hackerrank.com) have the advantage of being able to be administered remotely, and are usually designed to be completed in the candidates own time within a specified time limit. This makes them much easier to fit into a schedule, provides a well defined block of time within which to focus while also preventing overly meticulous candidates from taking a weekend to complete what should be a 2 hour assessment.

The negative aspects of this approach are centred around the impersonal nature of the assessments and the way in which they’re deployed. If you decide to include this in your interview process, make sure that somebody takes ownership of it. It should be this person’s responsibility to maintain the integrity of the assessments (don’t send out the same test for months and years at a time, switch it up every now and then) while also moving people through the pipeline and being available as a human to talk to if the person taking the test has any questions.

Additionally, it’s worth mentioning that there will usually be costs involved in using an online code assessment service, either in the form of a subscription or per-use fee.

The automatic scoring systems that many of these online testing tools use often lack the ability to pick up on nuance, meaning that smart developers often don’t get results that reflect their true ability. This can be counteracted by making it part of your process for a human to review the code that gets submitted.
