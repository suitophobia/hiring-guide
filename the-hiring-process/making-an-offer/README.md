# Making an offer

**In tech hiring, you should always assume that you’re competing for the attention of any given candidate with a host of other companies who are just as determined as you are to hire the best people.** This means that it should be your goal throughout this whole process to set yourself up to make a hire/not-hire decision as quickly as possible.

“Congratulations, we like you and want you to join our team” can be an awesome thing to hear after going through an interview process, but can also bring with it an interesting variety of follow-up questions. If you haven’t prepared for these they can throw a rather large spanner in the works.

Remember that at the end of the day, you’re asking somebody to commit a large portion of their waking hours to your company and your mission for the foreseeable future, so you should **be prepared to make sure that the person has access to as much information as possible so that they can make the best decision.**
