# Testing the waters

From time to time we’ll see companies sending out thinly-veiled non-offers that typically adopt the format of “If we were to make you an offer, would you accept?”. A message like this can be confusing to receive, especially if you’ve already got an offer on the table from another company and can come off as extremely non-committal

While it’s understandable in the context of trying to avoid rejection, a general rule should be: **if you’re in a position to make a hypothetical offer to somebody, you should also be in a position to make an actual one.**
