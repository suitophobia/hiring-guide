# Contract

We’ve already established that **if you want to hire somebody, you should be trying your best to make this intention known to them as soon as possible.** Because contracts can take some time to be drafted, an offer letter can sometimes be used to signal this intention quickly, however if you can send somebody an actual employment contract in the same space of time as an offer, then it makes sense to do this.

The motivation behind this is mostly psychological; **a contract can be seen as a bigger sign of commitment from a company than an offer letter** (just remember to sign it before you send it through).

If you know that you’re not going to be able to provide a contract super quickly, be upfront and say this rather than creating expectations for something that you can’t deliver.
