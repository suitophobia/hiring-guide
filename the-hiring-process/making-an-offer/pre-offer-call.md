# Pre-offer call

**Telling somebody that you want them on your team is a big deal.** Both parties have put in a lot of effort at this stage, so it makes sense to celebrate a bit - treat it like a victory lap. Like a lot of other important life events, this is news that deserves more than an email. **Pick up the phone!**

While delivering the good news, you’ll have a great opportunity to run them through the details of the offer and pre-empt any common questions: how many leave days are included, what kind of deductions can they expect on their payslip, potential start dates, etc. It’s really important to give the person a chance to ask any questions and to be very clear about when you’re expecting to receive a response.
