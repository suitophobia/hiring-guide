# Offer email

If for whatever reason you’re absolutely not able to contact somebody over the phone to tell them about an offer, you’ll need to adapt your strategy accordingly. Be as explicit in the email as possible about all of the information included in the offer and make sure that the person you’re making the offer to knows that you’d be more than happy to contact them to talk through the details.

**Lines of communication need to be wide open at this stage of the process** and if you’ve had to fall back on email for an offer, be sure to keep trying the phone until you get hold of them.
