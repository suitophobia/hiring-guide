# Calling references

#### &#x20;<a href="#_calling_references" id="_calling_references"></a>

Before you dial a single digit into the phone, it’s really important that you articulate just what it is that you’re hoping to achieve by contacting somebody’s references. **Are you looking to enlist third parties to provide you with information in order to help you make a hiring decision, or have you already made a decision and you’re doing a quick check for any serious red flags?**

In general, **try to avoid speaking to a reference before you’ve spoken to the candidate yourself.** It might feel useful to have a heads up before they’ve even come in for an interview, but remember that you’ve just potentially coloured your own first impression of this person with somebody else’s opinion.

Remember that when doing reference calls, your goal shouldn’t be to simply confirm what it is you’ve already learned about somebody during an interview. [A useful mindset to adopt](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/how-to-make-better-reference-calls-d493a12714f0) would be one of **“everything we’ve heard about the candidate so far is great, but we just want to make sure that we haven’t missed anything”.**

It should go without saying that you should always be respectful of the private nature of the candidate’s job search. **NEVER** phone somebody’s current workplace without their explicit permission, and **don’t solicit your own personal network for information without doing your homework.** The world is a small place, even more so in tech. People can be connected in unexpected ways, so it’s advised to limit your reference checks to people that the person that you’re hiring has provided for this purpose.
