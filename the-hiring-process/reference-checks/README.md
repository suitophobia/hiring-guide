# Reference checks

The first step here should have happened before the interview process even began. You need to have a decision in place where you set out whether or not you do background checks for everyone you hire, just for some people (maybe they’re working on-site at a client) or nobody at all. Whatever you decide, it’s important that you stick to it. It’s scarily easy to get swept up in the smiles and good vibes that are in the air after interviewing somebody that really fits in with the team and seems to tick every box that you threw at them, but that’s not necessarily a good reason to short circuit your own process.
