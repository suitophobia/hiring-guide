# Criminal and credit

If you’re hiring in a fintech or financial services space, you probably already know something about these kinds of checks. If you’re operating in a different space you’ll need to **decide how important clear credit and police records are in your particular context.**

No matter which side of the isle you’re on, an important consideration should be how these checks impact your hiring process and the candidate experience. **Be sure to give people an adequate heads up as to why you’re running these potentially invasive background checks on them,** and always provide an opportunity for the other person to be up-front about any irregularities that might come up.

Getting set up to do these yourself is cheaper and easier than you think. All you need to do is buy a fingerprint scanner, install some software and get somebody from your team to do a super short course from MIE.
