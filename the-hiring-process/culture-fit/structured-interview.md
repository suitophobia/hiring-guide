# Structured interview

The easiest way to get answers is to ask questions, you just need to make sure that you’re asking the right ones. If cross-team collaboration is central to your culture, an effective way of determining whether somebody would tick this box would be to ask them to relate to you specific instances in their career where they collaborated across different teams. If you choose this approach, it will be super important that you clearly explicate beforehand what your culture is, and what kinds of questions you’ll be including in this interview.
