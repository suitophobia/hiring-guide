# Meet the team

**The opinions of people that have been living and breathing the culture already can be a really useful barometer when assessing overall fit.** Carrying this out in a structured way will usually involve some planning, where short slots are booked with a number of members of team for them to have informal discussions. These are not only useful for you, but for the candidate as well, as they give them an opportunity to pose questions that they might not feel comfortable asking in a traditional interview scenario. If you decide to go down this route, remember to take some time to debrief everyone involved and gather their feedback.
