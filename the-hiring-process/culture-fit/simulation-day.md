# Simulation day

**A simulation day involves a candidate taking time to come to your office for a full day or two to do real work with the rest of your team.** Doing this can give you an insane level of insight into how they would approach solving real business problems and integrate into the rest of your team, while also giving the candidate a window into what a typical workday at your company can look like.

This comes at a pretty steep cost in terms of both time, planning and dedicated team resources during the course of the simulation days. It can be really tricky to design a good simulation day, however weâ€™ve run a lot of these as [part of our own hiring process](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/how-offerzen-hires) and would be more than happy to help you design your own.
