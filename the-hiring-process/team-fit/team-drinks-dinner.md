# Team drinks/dinner

If you really want to get a feel for somebody, put them at a dinner table with the rest of your team and let the conversation take its course. As an example, when OfferZen invites somebody for a simulation day for a Talent Advisor role, the whole TA team will often get together for a breakfast so that everybody can introduce themselves.

These kinds of engagements can give you a lot of opportunities to get to know somebody, as long as you’re careful to limit the scope of what you’re assessing to things that are relevant to your company and culture. You might find it strange that somebody dips their chips in their milkshake, but it’s definitely not a reason to turn somebody down at this stage of the hiring process.
