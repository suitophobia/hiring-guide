# Onsite chat

The easiest way to facilitate a team fit discussion is to literally just get the candidate in the same room as one or multiple members of the current team (this group should potentially include team leads or senior members) and get them to talk about whatever they find interesting. While getting people to talk is almost always educational, your goal in these discussions should be to drive the conversation towards what they look for in a team and how they tend to function best in a team environment.
