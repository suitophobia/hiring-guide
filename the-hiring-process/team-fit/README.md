# Team fit

Team fit can be thought of as a subset of company culture, or depending how small your company is, the same thing altogether. The mindset behind these kinds of discussions tend to be more granular than determining alignment between a candidate’s career goals and a company’s mission, with more focus being put on smaller scale team dynamics.

You’ve spent a lot of time trying to hire the best possible team, why not show them off? Smart people tend to want to hang out and solve problems with other smart people, so showing that you can provide this kind of environment can be a super compelling reason to join a company.
