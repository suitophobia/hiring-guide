# Interviewing



Good news; they like you, or at least they’re interested in talking to you to find out more about what you do. At this point, all you probably know about the candidate is what you’ve read on their profile. Conversely, most of the candidate’s knowledge about you is probably derived from a combination of your website and OfferZen profile, which is usually not quite the full story.

To move forward, your goal should be to engage in a conversation where you tell the person you’re hoping to hire about your company and why it’s a great place to work, while they explain to you how they can help you with your mission. **The interview stage is the most important and nuanced part of the hiring process and it will almost always be the point where the vast majority of information is shared** between your company and the prospective hire, and it is this information that will determine whether a potential offer is made, or accepted.

**We can subdivide the interview process into a few discrete phases:**

* **The initial conversation** - the first structured outreach between your company and the candidate.
* **The technical assessment** - determining whether the person in question has the technical background to add value to your team.
* **The culture/team fit assessment** - determining whether or not there is resonance between the person’s goals/motivations and company’s mission and team environment.

There are a number of ways in which you can undertake each of these steps, but a few interviewing best practices apply universally:

* In their book [“Who”](https://www.takealot.com/who-ebook/PLID37100175), Geoff Smart and Randy Street popularised the concept of a scorecard. This is essentially an internal job specification that you create with the goal of giving you a more objective idea of what the job entails, and what a successful applicant should look like. This tool can be really useful in organising your thoughts on just who it is you’re trying to hire and will make asking focussed interview questions a lot easier. A scorecard consists of a few key components:
  * **Mission** - a description of the high level goal of the position.
  * **Outcomes** - what are you expecting of the person who excels in this role? Try to keep these as objective and measurable as possible.
  * **Competencies** - what kind of skills are necessary in order to achieve the outcomes that you defined.
* Asking questions about how somebody would hypothetically approach certain situations in the workplace is not the most effective way of interviewing someone. **In reality, you can derive much more effective insights by focussing on what somebody actually did in a given situation:**
  * What were you hired to do?
  * What did you accomplish?
  * What mistakes did you make in this job?
  * Who did you work with and what do think of them?
  * Why did you leave this job?
* **Be organised.** An interview is a pretty big time investment from both sides, so make the most of it by having a structured agenda for what you’re hoping to accomplish. **Everyone involved should know what their roles are,** and the order of proceedings should be explained to interviewee at the outset.
