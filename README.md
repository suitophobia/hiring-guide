# Building the ultimate tech hiring process

**Hiring is hard;** you’re trying to get the best people, but so is everybody else. The melee that ensues can be tough to navigate at the best of times, and having a well thought out hiring strategy is critical to success.

Demand for quality tech candidates currently [far outstrips supply](https://www.offerzen.com/blog/how-long-does-it-take-a-developer-to-find-a-job) and it’s not going to change any time soon. Now more than ever, securing a steady supply of talent is a strategic and competitive necessity. As an adaptation, we have seen successful companies adopt a new mindset. **Instead of filtering to ensure that people are good enough to work at the company, they ask themselves how they can attract top talent.**

Over the last 2 years we’ve been able to have conversations with over 800 of SA’s top tech companies about their hiring processes. During these discussions we’ve been able to gather an enormous amount of data on how to design an effective hiring process while also seeing them play out from the candidate’s perspective.
